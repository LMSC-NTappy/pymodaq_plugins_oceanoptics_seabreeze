PyMoDAQ Plugin
===============

plugin to control Ocean insight spectrometers through the PyMoDAQ abstraction layer: http://pymodaq.cnrs.fr/

Relies on the fantastic python-seabreeze library: https://python-seabreeze.readthedocs.io/

In the current state, tested with a USB2000+ spectrometer.
Expected to work with most spectrometers supported by the seabreeze library since it supports only basic functionalities

Feel free to contact authors for advanced features integration or in the case of unsupported models.
